# Flappy-Bird-Game-using-create.js
## Create the complete Flappy Bird clone using the Create.js suite of libraries: Easel.js for drawing, Tween.js for motion and Preload.js for asset loading.
#### To get started, we’ll draw the background and clouds with Easel.js to a canvas. To load the clouds (and other assets), we’ll use Preload.js. The background is simply a gradient specified in the JavaScript. Start by creating a HTML file that houses the canvas element.

### Start by Drawing the Environment with Easel.js
#### Note that in many modern browsers, such as Chrome, you can’t view WebGL content by simply double clicking the HTML file and opening it in the browser. It must be served by a web server. 
#### The python HTTP server works well for testing. Open the directory where your game is and run `python3 -m http.server` or `python -m http.server` then navigate to localhost:8000.
### Loading Our Assets: game.js
